#### There is nothing to see here yet as the project is in the very early development stage.

This project is an experimental playground to try implementing an application with only Jetpack Compose without using the old Android UI framework.
This application will only have the minimal feature support (Catalog/Thread viewing, posting, bookmarks, album, media viewer, etc.). No advansed stuff like archives, sound posts, thirdeye, anti-captcha services etc.
Some stuff (like html parsing, media decoding, something else) is planned to be written in a compiled language (probably Rust) for maximum performance.
