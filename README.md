This project is an experimental playground to try implementing an application with only Jetpack Compose without using the old Android UI framework.
This application will only have the minimal feature support (Catalog/Thread viewing, posting, bookmarks, album, media viewer, some other stuff). No advansed stuff like archives, sound posts, thirdeye, anti-captcha services etc.
Some stuff (like html parsing, media decoding, something else) is planned to be written in a compiled language (probably Rust) for maximum performance.

There is not much to see yet, but if you are really interested you will have to build the project yourself (You will need to generate the keys to sign a release build. Alternatively, you can make a debug build but it will be less performant). Expect bugs, obviously. Right now you can only visit threads from one board: /g/ (you can also open any other thread by using the "Open thread by identifier" option in the catalog menu), you can navigate reply chains, use search and that's pretty much it. The Main work is currently being done on the general UI/UX which is going to be different from KurobaEx.
